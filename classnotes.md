* Eager loading: define what you're loading in from an array, meaning you can join relations into the query, efficiently loading data into memory.
* Lazy loading: Loading the object itself, but not loading its relations.

> I am not sure if there's something like eager loading with Diesel, should probably look into that/prepare good argumentation for the assessment.
